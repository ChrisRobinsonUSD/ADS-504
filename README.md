The data mining goals for this project are to determine which predictors have the highest correlation with a customer subscribing to a term deposit account. There is high risk associated with this project as inaccurate predictions will negatively affect bank revenue. A model that does not correctly classify customers will lead to ineffective marketing practices and may potentially offer accounts to customers which are poor candidates for such investments.
